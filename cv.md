### About Myself


My career started as a coffee maker. At this time I studied drawing and software for this. I did all this to get into gamedev. 


I was looking for where to start studying in programming and went to work in the marketplace. After working there, I decided it was time to move on and started learning things on my own. But I didn't do well.


Now that I have found what exactly I like, I decided to study front-end development and now I am in RS school


### Code example


``` 
function multiply(a, b){
  return a * b
} 
```
